# About The Project

**Airport Statistics Application** This C++ program searches through a United States airports dataset of over 100,000 tuples. The user can search by airport code and get information regarding the delays in that specific airport. This program also compares runtime and efficiency of different sorting algorithms such as radix and shell sort.

The airport statistics were pulled from the following dataset: [airlines (2).csv](https://github.com/kevinochoa8266/Airport-Statistics/files/9641626/airlines.2.csv)
